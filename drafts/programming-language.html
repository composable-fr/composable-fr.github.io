A number of Lisps now compile into byte code, which is then executed
by an interpreter. This is usually done to make the implementation
easier to port, but it could be a useful language feature. It might be
a good idea to make the byte code an official part of the language,
and to allow programmers to use inline byte code in bottlenecks. Then
such optimizations would be portable too.
