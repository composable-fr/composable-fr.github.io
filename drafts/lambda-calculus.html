    <h1>Lambda calculus</h1>

    <p><emph>Oh noes!</emph> You are stranded on a desert greek island. A
      rescue party is on its way, but won't arrive until a couple of days. How
      to deal with the boredom? Fortunately, there's a computer on the beach,
      with a greek keyboard layout. Unfortunately, all keys are broken except
      for <kbd>λ</kbd>, <kbd>(</kbd> and <kbd>)</kbd>. Can you still program
      with this?</p>

    <p>Welcome to the world of the lambda calculus!</p>

    <p>The code in this file can be tested using
      the <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> language, but any
      version of Lisp or Scheme will do (for some versions you will need to
      use the <code>lambda</code> instead of the <code>λ</code>
      shorthand).</p>

      <h2>Our tool: lambda functions</h2>

      <p>A lambda function is an anonymous function. It accepts some
      arguments, processes them and returns some value. For example, the
	following function has a single argument <var>x</var>, and returns
	<var>x</var> without modification (i.e. it is the identity function):</p>
      <pre>
(λ (x)
  x)</pre>

      <p>It is similar to following Python declaration:</p>
      <pre>
def anonymous1(x):
  return x;</pre>

      <section>
	<h3>Character restrictions</h3>
	
	<p>Remember, you're stranded with no other keys than <kbd>λ</kbd>,
	  <kbd>(</kbd> and <kbd>)</kbd>. The only allowed variable names
	  are therefore <code>λλ</code>, <code>λλλ</code>, <code>λλ…λ</code>
	  (<code>λ</code> on its own is already used as the built-in keyword
	  for creating lambda functions). For convenience and readability, I
	  will use normal variable names in this document, but all variable
	  names could be numbered and replaced by <code>λλ</code> for the
	  first, <code>λλλ</code> for the second etc., and the program would
	  still produce the same output.</p>

      <h2>Naming values to reuse them</h2>

      <p>An anonymous function cannot be referred to by its name, since it
	does not have one. It can be called immediately, like so:</p>
      <pre>
((λ (x) x) <var>argument</var>)</pre>

      <p>
	Alternatively, the <code>(λ (x) x)</code> expression can be bound to a
	variable, so that it can be reused multiple times. We do this by
	passing it as an argument to another function, which effectively binds
	<code>(λ (x) x)</code> to the other function's parameter:

	<pre>
((λ (f) <var>f can be used here multiple times</var>)
 (λ (x) x))</pre>
      </p>

      <h2>Representing data: booleans</h2>

      <p>As you may have noticed, we cannot write any data literals, like the
	numbers <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, or the
	booleans<code>#true</code> and <code>#false</code>.</p>

      <p>The only tool at our disposal being lambda functions, we have
	torepresent booleans using lambda functions. Can you think of a way to
	encode two distinct values with a function, and be able to
	recognizethem by calling it?</p>

      <section>
	<h3>An attempt using arbitrary functions to represent booleans</h3>
	
	<p>It is tempting to chose two arbitrary functions to represent
	  <code>#true</code> and <code>#false</code>, for example the identity
	  function <code>(λ (x) x)</code> and a function returning the identity
	  function <code>(λ (y) (λ (x) x))</code>. We would then want to test a
	  value for equality with these two functions, in order to determine if
	  the value is the first (representing <code>#true</code>) or the second
	  (representing <code>#false</code>).</p>

	<p>It is notoriously problematic to test for the equality of functions:
	  two functions with very different implementations could behave exactly
	  in the same way, and checking that they do is an instance of the
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halting%20problem">halting problem</a>.
	  Our case is much simpler, as the functions will have the same implementation,
	  but most languages still do not offer a way to test for the
	  "source code equality" of two functions (it would be a very brittle test
	  anyway).</p>

	<p>We could instead create the values representing <code>#true</code>
	  and <code>#false</code> once and for all, and use the two same values
	  throughout the program:</p>

	<pre>
(((λ (t)
    (λ (f)
      <var class="varblock">Use t and f here, and perform tests with
(if (eq? v t) true-branch false-branch)</var>))
  (λ (x) x))          ;; #true
 (λ (y) (λ (x) x))) ;; #false</pre>

	<p>Unfortunately, we do not even have an <code>eq?</code> predicate,
	  which would test whether two values are stored at the same location
	  in memory (i.e. they originally were one single value which was
	  copied around). We don't have an <code>if</code> form either, so
	  this approach is not going to work.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
	<h3>The solution</h3>
	
	<p>Since we can't compare values, we will have to determine whether a
	  function represents true or false by calling it. If the function
	  returns some kind of truth or falseness when it is called, it will
	  only move the problem one step further, as we will then need to ask
	  the question “Is the returned value true or false?”.</p>

	<p>Try to pause for a moment and think about a solution.</p>

	<hr />

	<p>We cannot distinguish the two functions representing <code>#true</code>
	  and <code>#false</code>. Instead, these functions will behave like some
	  kind of <code>if</code> form, the first one always returning the
	  result of the true branch, and the other always returning the result
	  of the false branch.
	</p>

	<pre>
(((λ (t)
    (λ (f)
      <var class="varblock">Use t and f here, and write conditionnals as follows:
(v the-true-branch the-false-branch)</var>))
  (λ (true-branch) (λ (false-branch) true-branch)))
 (λ (true-branch) (λ (false-branch) false-branch)))</pre>
	
	<p>
	  Currying is the process of filling in the arguments of a function
	  one by one, each time producing a partially applied function, until
	  the last argument is passed. A curried version of the addition
	  function would take a first number, and return a function which
	  expects a second number, returning the sum of both numbers. The key
	  point is that the second function can be saved and reused many
	  times. For example, passing <code>1</code> to the curried addition
	  would produce a function which increments its argument. Passing
	  <code>2</code> to the curried multiplication would produce a
	  function which doubles its argument.</p>
	<p>In a way, our solution is equivalent to currying the function
	  <code>(if condition true-branch false-branch)</code>, and defining
	  our representations of <code>#true</code> and <code>#false</code> as
	  <code>if</code> curried with <code>#true</code> (respectively
	  <code>#false</code>) for its first argument.
