    <h1>A take on Distributed Version Control</h1>
    <p>
      Simplify the number of core concepts as much as possible:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>object: referred to by its cryptographic hash
        <ul>
          <li>file patch: a diff from N input files (for merges) to 1 output</li>
          <li>directory patch: combines file patches, knows about renamed
          files within that directory</li>
          <li>commit message: a piece of text</li>
          <li>commit: patch + message</li>
          <li>commit group: list of commits (or commit groups) that are
          grouped in a single one, reordering, …</li>
          <li>meta-commit: list of pointers with their values, …</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>pointer: referred to by its name. points to another pointer, or to
        an object.</li>
      <li>nested lists where the leaves are pointers (could also be seen as a
      flat namespace with special prefix in names</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The traditionnal branches, tags, remote branches, master "trunk" branch,
      HEAD are implemented as pointers. HEAD points to a branch, tag or
      directly to a commit object. A branch points to a commit object, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      The working directory is a special continuously-updated commit. When
      switching branches, you can either change the working directory, which
      leaves the changes as an automatic "working directory" commit on top of
      the previous branch (or on top of the previous detached HEAD). On the
      other hand, switching with the <code>--no-workdir</code> option
      effectively "rebases" the "working directory" commit on top of the new
      branch.
    </p>

    <p>
      A groupped-commit indicates how the history should be displayed. For
      example, given a set of four commits, c1 c2 c3 c4, the history can be
      displayed as c1+3 then c2+4, provided that the commits can be
      re-ordered (like with darcs). If necessary, c1+3 and c2+4 can act as
      merges, but always keep a reference to the old commits that they
      represent. Also, after applying c1+3 and c2+4, the result should be
      identical to the original state after applying c1 c2 c3 c4 (so that
      other merges can think in terms of the plain commits, and don't have to
      worry about the groupped commits).
    </p>

    <p>
      The stream of meta-commit acts as a stream of events like the one showed
      by <code>git pull</code>: a list of updated pointers. This means that
      branches can safely be deleted on the "public" version of the
      repository, as browsing through the history should show something like:
    </p>
    <pre>
current-state: master→abcde dev→adebc …
branch tmp was deleted (unmerged)
branch tmp was updated → cccdb
branch tmp was created → cccda
branch bugfix was deleted (merged into dev and xyz)
branch xyz was updated → merge bugfix
branch dev was updated → merge bugfix
branch bugfix was updated → aaabb
branch bugfix was created → aaacc
    </pre>
    <p>
      Only the meta-commit stream for public branches is pushed, so "fake"
      branches created by stash or 
    </p>

    <p>
      The core set of commands operates on the core concepts:
    </p>
    <pre>
core file-patch create …
core file-patch show _hash_
core directory-patch create …
core commit-message create …
core commit create …
core set-pointer name new-hash …    # Checks that the new-hash is a commit hash, not something else
    </pre>

    <p>
      The user-friendly commands should have a very regular syntax. All
      commands that change the HEAD should have the option <code>--no-workdir</code>. Commands
      that create commits should have the option <code>--workdir</code>,
      <code>--untracked</code>, <code>--stash</code>,
      and take an optional list of files. These options include the unstaged
      changes in the workdir, include the untracked files (useful for
      stash), and create a stash/1, stash/2 etc pointer to the commit.
      <code>dvcs stash</code> is just an alias for <code>dvcs commit --stash</code>,
      and <code>--stash</code> is actually just an alias for
      <code>--create-pointer stash/<var>auto-incremented-number</var></code>. When
      no file is given (and when the option <code>--</code> is not passed, so
      that scripts do not have to worry about the 0 files special-case), the
      staged changes are committed (unless <code>--untracked</code> or
      <code>--workdir</code> etc. are specified, in which case these changes
      are added too). If a file is specified, then the changeset is restrained
      to contain only that file. By default, it will commit the staged changes,
      but in combination with <code>--workdir</code> all changes within that
      file can be included.

      When showing the workdir at the top of a "log" command, we should
      actually show four commits: abcde-staged, abcde-workdir,
      abcde-untracked, abcde-ignored, where abcde
      is the permanent commit. That way, the relation is clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Customizable: all commands should be extensively customizable. Rules to
      ignore whitespace, custom diff tool, …
    </p>

    <p>
      language-specific patch format: a patch contains a reference to a diff
      tool, coded in a safe language and run in complete isolation. That way,
      future repositories aren't limited by the tool's initial
      shortcommings. This makes it possible to use specific binary diff tools
      (e.g. for pictures). The code for a patch format should be simple enough
      that it can easily be included inside the remote repo (we're talking
      about applying patches here, not about computing the diff or displaying
      it).
    </p>

    <p>
      Clearly separate the storage backend (patches + bytecode for each kind
      of patch), the core concepts (the actual history + meta-history), and
      the sugar on top (show the meta-history, not the history, unless the
      user asks for it). Last but not least: the remote protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend is concerned with efficiently storing the repository's
      information (compact size, easy to extract the appropriate pieces to
      that it is feasible to clone a commit range for a subdirectory)
    </p>
    <p>
      That clear separation should help enable multiple models, for example
      it should be possible to have multiple branches checked out
      simultaneously, with their storage pointing to a centralized storage
      directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Things to think about:
      <ul>
        <li>hierarchy: it should be possible to clone a subdirectory / commit
          range / both and work on it (commit, pull, push, amend the
          meta-history, …) without needing the rest of the repository.

          The patches should therefore be hierarchical in some way, so that
          the patch for a whole directory does not need to reference patches
          for files outside the directory. From the commit, you then only need
          to traverse the patches down until the relevant directory.

          What about "dumb" servers (i.e. just the repo hosted on an HTTP
          server)?  Probably we can expect degraded functionnality there (I
          doubt it's possible to easily pick one single file of one single
          commit without fetching anything else, unless there are thousands of
          files/urls, in which case fetching the whole repo would be horribly
          slow).
        </li>
    </p>

    <p>
      Also: log for a specific line / sexp (seems git does this for lines with git log -L)
